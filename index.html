                <h3>Blog Post 1: Huge Save from the Backup!</h3>
                <h4>A simple and easy reminder.</h4>
                <p>The first cyber-related detail I'd like to share with everyone is one that seems so simple and is yet overlooked so very often. Think to yourself about the last project you did,
		   the last essay you wrote, or even the last video game you played. Now, I want you to think about how long it took for you to go through your project/essay/video game until you realized 
		   that you hadn't saved your progress! More time often than not, I'd like to think we catch ourselves and quickly save before any real damage is done but that is not the reality for some
		   people. It seems mundane and obvious to do but when you are in the thick of whatever it is you're doing, it can be quite easy to forget to save or create a backup of it and by the 
		   time you figure it out, the power goes out at home and you've lost everything you've done up to that point and have to start all over. Starting all over isn't an ideal scenario 
		   so just SAVE yourself the heartbreak and save your files every so often (see what I did there?). Creating backups of your files or projects is also a splendid idea you can use too. If you
		   make an error so egregious that you can't recover the original file, the backup can come in to save the day and you'll be able to relax just a little bit more. Hopefully this simple
		   tip is a good enough reminder for you to implement good saving practices into your cyber life and you will never have to worry about power outages or faulty computers again!

                <h3>Blog Post 2: Secure the Perimeter! </h3>
                <h4>Peter Peter Peter, no good network goes unprotected.</h4>
                <p>
                    Network security plays a huge role in the cybersecurity world, mainly in...well, security. Keeping your netowrk safe and sound from any potenial outside threat actor or attck is vital to 
		    keeping all of your sensitve information in the right hands. Login credentials, company data secrets, access to the network itself, and even the file your coworker Jeff keeps on his company 
		    computer that shows how many times he flew to some random island with a bunch of celebrities for some reason are all capable of being leaked and exposed if certain security
		    precautions are not taken. While there are many details that we could dive into about this, let's cover some of the basic ones first to start you off. Firstly, make sure you are
		    using firewall for your networks. Firewalls help establish barriers between your secure internal network and the hazardous possibilites of a bored threat actor. Second, encryption is KEY! 
		    (you must love me by now) Encrytping sensitive information is an absolute essential to keep your data and other information safe. Only give the decryption keys to those deemed necessary 
	  	    and make sure that those keys stay with them at all times until the work they need to do is done. Next, you could set up an IDS or an IPS as an added layer of security. These systems will 
		    provide security measure that will detect and prevent attacks on your network and keep you from having to call Rami Malek to help fix things. Lastly, and this is a big one, make sure your
		    employees are being smart with their company devices. Phising scams are an easy way for attackers to get into devices with very little effort needed. Make sure your employees are
		    well informed about what a potenial scam could look like and to not click on any emails or links that are not from trusted sources. It's not difficult for a threat actor to gain access
		    with that technique and all they would need is a simple computer with no added equipment, never underestimate the power of a madman with a box. Now that we've gone over some key points,
		    you can look in the mirror and see if you are utilizing any of them and see where some imporvments could be made in your own day to day life. We can't give the bad guys any room to get in 
		    so swe have to do what we can to prevent it all together.
